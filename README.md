# EpidemicSimulator

This is a project to discover the feasibility of using Rust for large scale agent base modelling of Epidemics, and to
discover the impact that real world census data can have on the simulation.

It is inspired by EpiRust (https://github.com/thoughtworks/epirust) and similar projects.

It utilises UK Census data from 2011, to model the population of the UK and their movements.

warning: Patch `quadtree_rs v0.1.2 (https://github.com/NoSuchThingAsRandom/quadtree/#321fcd31)` was not used in the crate graph.
Check that the patched package version and available features are compatible
with the dependency requirements. If the patch has a different version from
what is locked in the Cargo.lock file, run `cargo update` to use the new
version. This may also occur with an optional dependency that is not enabled.
